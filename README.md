# Procedural Generated Terrain
A project, using the OpenGL API and GLSL code, to produce a terrain which can be infinitely & procedurally generated. The project uses a game engine I have been developing the last few months.

The project contains the following implementations:

> Tessellation Shaders to control the level of detail of the terrain (Distant dependant) using a variety of methods (Step, Linear and Exponential)
> Bloom post processing along with the Blinn-Phong lighting model
